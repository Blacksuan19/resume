      \item \textbf{\link[Aflutter Craft: Neural Art Transfer Platform]{https://blacksuan19.dev/aflutter-craft}}
            \newline A platform that utilizes Style Attentional Networks (SANet) simplify the process of applying style transfer to images, with a Python APl and cross-platform app built with Flutter.
      \item \textbf{\link[Fish Species Classification Using Images and ResNet]{https://blacksuan19.dev/projects/fish-classification-with-pytorch-resnet}}
            \newline Developed a fish species classification model utilizing a modified ResNet CNN architecture, Achieving a test accuracy of 87.11\% after implementing robust augmentation techniques, demonstrating the model's reliability and accuracy.
      \item \textbf{\link[Heart Attack Prediction Using Neural networks]{https://blacksuan19.dev/projects/heart-attack-classification-with-pytorch}}
            \newline Predict risk of heart attack using key medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, and cholesterol levels, among others. The Trained neural network demonstrates an 85\% accuracy in the test set.
      \item \textbf{\link[COVID-19 Forecasting using LSTM, ARIMA, HES]{https://blacksuan19.dev/projects/covid-19-forecasting-lstms-and-statistical-models/}}
            \newline Utilized time series forecasting techniques to predict COVID-19 cases, deploying LSTM, ARIMA, and HES models with an average error rate of 3\%. Successfully forecasted COVID-19 cases across time and countries.
